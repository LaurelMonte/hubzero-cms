For this reason, reference documents for most tests report rotation in some format. Unfortunately, the various references define rotation in different ways, and many give no definition for reported values. A complete definition of rotation should be clear about whether total (elastic plus plastic) or just plastic rotation is considered and should state which components (beam, column, panel zone, etc.) have contributed to the reported value. If the reported rotation is calculated as the quotient of a displacement and a member length, the length used should be clearly defined as well.  An effort was made to record rotation values wherever possible, even though reported definitions were sometimes unclear or inconsistent. In some cases an approximate elastic contribution was subtracted to obtain the listed plastic rotation.  Some source documents reported plastic rotation at the beam hinge. This typically includes the beam contribution only and is calculated based on the length from the beam tip to the hinge. In order to convert this to a corresponding rotation at the column centerline (per FEMA 267A, Figure 6.6.5-1), the hinge-to-column centerline distance, Lh, is also recorded if available. Other documents reported plastic rotation due to panel zone distortion alone. Still others reported an overall plastic rotation relative to the column centerline with contributions from all components.
